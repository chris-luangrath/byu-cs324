1. socket and connect

2. you would use sendto() or sendmsg() instead of send() or write(), and instead of binding a local 
address with bind(), a free local port would be bound to INADDR_ANY

3. they will come from the commandline (argv)

4. The port values are the same

5. The port values are different

6. One for all clients

7. 3 calls to write()

8. The kernal receives 2 messages after the initial message.

9. 3 calls to recvfrom()

10. "All receive operations return only one packet."

11. Listen() marks the socket as passive, making it available to use. 
Accept() finds a passive socket to use for the next connection.

12. If udp/the socket type is sock_dgram, it correlates a socket with port to receive data from
If tcp/the socket type is is sock_stream, it will perform a 3-way handshake with the server

13. Messages are sent to confirm communication in the initial connection

14. The port value for different messages on the same socket is the same

15. The port value for different messages on different sockets are different

16. The server uses one socket for each client, compard to UDP that uses one socket for all clients.

17. Client made 3 calls to write/sendto

18. The kernal received 3 messages in the first call to recv

19. The kernal made 1 call

20. Question 9 used the udp socket, processed the 3 messages seperately. Question 19 with the TCP uses
a stream, so it's able to process all the messages so soon as it receives it.

21. The output is 0ef39a3f241cdd6552ad131e01afa9171b3dab8d

1. Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In ev'ry change he faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend
Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as he has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

26. It hangs until it receives a message 

27. If the amount of data available is less than the requested amount, then read/recv will say that
it read the requested amount of data, but bad data will be written to the buffer.

28. It only reads the specified amount of bytes of each message sent, moving to the next message after
processing that amount.
