1. socket and connect

2. you would use sendto() or sendmsg() instead of send() or write(), and instead of binding a local 
address with bind(), a free local port would be bound to INADDR_ANY

3. they will come from the commandline (argv)

4. The port values are the same

5. The port values are different

6. One for all clients

7. 3 calls to write()

8. 1? I mean, the messages are sent almost immediately, so technically after it recieves the first 
message, there are two more floating around. But the server still prints one at a time, which I
guess means it receives only 1?

9. 3 calls to recvfrom()

10. "All receive operations return only one packet."

11. Listen() marks the socket as passive, making it available to use. 
Accept() finds a passive socket to use for the next connection.

12. If udp/the socket type is sock_dgram, it will only receive data from the address in addr.
If tcp/the socket type is is sock_stream, it will make a connection to the socket from the address in addr
(?)
